## Texture Mapping Unit
Texture Mapping is a way of adding realism to a 3D model by defining high-frequency detail, surface texture, or color information on the model. In this process, a 2D surface, also called a "Texture Map", is wrapped around a 3D model. This process is also called as diffuse mapping.

### The Basics of Texture Mapping
The idea is simple enough. Let's say you have a model of a house. What if it had window "panes" that were transparent, so you could see what's inside? 

Texture mapping is what achieves the kind of realistic quality required. Instead of just being plain white, the windows could be transparent with a glass-like texture. That way, what's inside the room can be seen through the window instead of what looks like nothing at all.

Texture mapping technique is not only useful for 3D modeling, but for 3D rendering as well:
- Textures can provide information on how 3D objects should look, how light reflects off of them, and how they should appear under certain conditions. This texture map data can be used on any 3D object, including people, buildings, landscapes, or anything that normally has a surface.
- Textures can also be added or subtracted to provide more detail or hide features you don't want the public to see.
- Textures can help 3D models look more 3D and less 2D.
