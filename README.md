## Texture Mapping Unit
Texture Mapping is a way of adding realism to a 3D model by defining high-frequency detail, surface texture, or color information on the model. In this process, a 2D surface, also called a "Texture Map", is wrapped around a 3D model. This process is also called as diffuse mapping.
